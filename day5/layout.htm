Great job! In this lesson, you learned how to control the positioning of elements on a web page.

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

The

 property allows you to specify the position of an element.
When set to

, an element’s position is relative to its default position on the page.
When set to

absolute
, an element’s position is relative to its closest positioned parent element. It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.
When set to

, an element’s position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.
When set to

, an element can stick to a defined offset position when the user scrolls its parent container.
The

The

 property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.
You can clear an element’s left or right side (or both) using the

Each element is made of four specific areas: - width and height: The width and height of the content area. - padding: The amount of space between the content area and the border. - border: The thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding. - margin: The amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.
